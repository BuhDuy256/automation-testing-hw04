# HW06 API Testing — Continuation Handoff

## 1. Current objective

The HW06 automation setup is complete and frozen. Actual homework execution is now underway: API selection, scoped specification, FR-04 AI generation, and FR-04 human review are complete. No Postman implementation, Newman execution, bug publication, or CI execution has started.

## 2. Human-confirmed API selection

Status: **FINAL — HUMAN CONFIRMED**

| Pool | Feature | Selected operation |
|---|---|---|
| A | FR-04 Personal profile management | `PUT /api/users/me` |
| B | FR-08 Checkout | `POST /api/checkout` |
| C | FR-15 Product management | `POST /api/products` |

The selection prioritizes assignment compliance, at least 35 meaningful cases per API, low implementation friction, and fast Postman/Newman execution. Do not rerank or reopen this decision unless a genuine implementation blocker is discovered later.

## 3. Interpretation used

The working interpretation is:

```text
one selected API = one HTTP method/path operation
```

Supporting requests such as login, GET verification, setup, and cleanup may be used without becoming additional selected APIs. This follows the HW06 wording and examples that refer to APIs, endpoints, and operations. FR-15 is a CRUD feature family, but the selected API is its create operation.

## 4. Canonical state

The confirmed selection is stored in:

- `work/registry/project.json`

Checkpoint:

```text
ACT-SEL-01
COMPLETED — HUMAN CONFIRMED

ACT-SPEC-01
COMPLETED — HUMAN VERIFIED
```

The three human-verified ACT-SPEC-01 extracts are stored in:

- `work/selection/HW06-A-FR04-PUT-USERS-ME-verified-spec.md`
- `work/selection/HW06-B-FR08-POST-CHECKOUT-verified-spec.md`
- `work/selection/HW06-C-FR15-POST-PRODUCTS-verified-spec.md`

All three are marked `VERIFIED — HUMAN CONFIRMED`. They are the controlled scoped inputs for test generation; the official SUT sources remain authoritative.

Each extract is source-anchored and explicitly marked `VERIFIED — HUMAN CONFIRMED`. The official sources remain authoritative:

- `docs/hw06-req/2026.HW06.API Testing_En.md`
- `eshop-sut/api_specification.md`
- `eshop-sut/README.md` for business/security rules

## 5. Selected API quick reference

### FR-04 — `PUT /api/users/me`

- Requires an authenticated user JWT.
- Main body fields: `name`, `shipping_address`, `phone`.
- FR-04 requires a phone beginning with `0` and containing 10–11 digits; email must not change; role must not be client-controlled.
- Setup: login with a known user and capture the baseline profile.
- Cleanup: restore the baseline profile; use `GET /api/users/me` for read-back/schema verification.
- Important dimensions: phone boundaries, missing/wrong-type fields, persistence, JWT failures, input escaping, parameterized persistence, and SEC-06 role tampering.

### FR-08 — `POST /api/checkout`

- Requires an authenticated user JWT.
- Body fields: `total_amount`, `shipping_address`.
- FR-08 requires the backend to calculate the total from cart state, reject a client-forged total, and clear the cart after successful checkout.
- Setup: login, establish a known cart when testing cart-derived behavior, then capture order/cart state.
- State/reset concerns: orders persist in SQLite; implementation cart state is process memory, so isolated runs may require disciplined ordering or a backend reset.
- Important dimensions: auth, amount mismatch/partitions, address input, empty/non-empty cart, order creation, cart clearing, schema, SEC-02/04/05.

### FR-15 — `POST /api/products`

- Expected authorization: valid JWT with `role = 'admin'`.
- Body fields: `name`, `price`, `description`, `imageUrl`, `category_id`.
- FR-15 requires non-empty name up to 255 characters, positive price, and an existing category.
- Setup: login as admin and obtain a known category.
- Cleanup: generate unique product names, capture created IDs, and delete created products or reset the seeded SQLite database.
- Important dimensions: field boundaries/types, category dependency, admin versus user/no token, response/schema, persistence, SEC-02/03/04/05.

## 6. Known implementation observations

These are **BUG HYPOTHESIS — NOT YET CONFIRMED**. They must become bugs only after real execution, reproduction, evidence capture, and human review:

- `PUT /api/users/me`: implementation appears to accept a client-supplied `role` field.
- `POST /api/checkout`: implementation appears to trust client `total_amount` rather than recomputing from cart state.
- `POST /api/checkout`: implementation appears not to clear the in-memory cart after checkout.
- `POST /api/products`: implementation appears to lack authentication/authorization middleware and server-side validation.

Do not convert these observations into expected behavior or final bug reports before execution.

## 7. Important test-design boundary

Do not invent expected validation behavior where the official specification is silent. Separate:

- official contract;
- exploratory/robustness cases;
- implementation observations;
- confirmed bugs.

SEC-04 HTML/XSS-like input is not automatically expected to be rejected by the API; SEC-04 concerns safe escaping at display/output boundaries. SEC-05 black-box injection tests can reveal vulnerabilities, but a safe API response alone does not prove that parameterized queries are used internally.

## 8. Standard actions already available

The authoritative action procedures are in `docs/hw06-standard-actions.md`. Likely next actions are:

`ACT-GEN-01` → `ACT-REV-01` → `ACT-EXT-01` → `ACT-PM-01` → `ACT-RUN-01` → `ACT-RUN-02` → `ACT-EVID-01` → `ACT-BUG-01` → `ACT-BUG-02` → `ACT-BUG-03` → `ACT-DERIVE-01` → `ACT-GIT-01`.

Other available actions include `ACT-RUN-02`, `ACT-CI-01`, `ACT-PM-02`, `ACT-AUDIT-01`, `ACT-GIT-02`, `ACT-SUB-01`, and `ACT-SUB-02`. Use the catalog and existing registries; do not create another workflow abstraction.

## 9. Automation/tool interfaces

Important existing commands:

```text
npm run hw06:validate
npm run hw06:derive
npm run hw06:git-log
```

Relevant existing scripts include `scripts/hw06/validate.mjs`, `derive.mjs`, `run-newman.mjs`, `capture-screenshot.mjs`, `capture-ci-run.mjs`, `publish-bug.mjs`, and `export-git-log.ps1`.

**DO NOT redesign the automation harness.** Edit canonical registries and use the established derivation/validation mechanisms.

## 10. Evidence rules

Never fabricate Newman execution, HTTP request/response data, bugs, screenshots, GitHub Issues, CI runs, commit SHAs, human reviews, or other evidence. Use real execution and attributable evidence only. The `X-Student-Id: 23127179` header is required on every eventual test request.

## 11. Current repository state

- Branch: `hw06-api-testing`
- Latest existing commit before this task: `adc2bd08315ae91009fbf3ec47c49dbf25ffb06a` (`feat(hw06): standardize recurring agent actions`)
- Validation: `npm run hw06:validate` passed with 0 errors and 0 warnings after selection persistence.
- Derivation: `npm run hw06:derive` completed and regenerated factual summaries showing 3 selected APIs and 47 FR-04 AI-generated candidates.
- Runtime-only modification: `eshop-sut/backend/database.sqlite` is modified in the working tree and is intentionally excluded from this work.
- This task’s intended files: the three verified files under `work/selection/` and `HANDOFF.md`; derived `work/generated/` outputs were regenerated by command and are not hand-edited.

## 12. Completed in this session

- ACT-SEL-01 completed: the three human-confirmed APIs were persisted in `work/registry/project.json` with real confirmation metadata.
- ACT-SPEC-01 completed for all three selected operations: the human verified the corrected extracts, and all three now carry `VERIFIED — HUMAN CONFIRMED` metadata.
- The former API-selection proposal status was updated to reflect final human confirmation.
- `out/README.md` was updated from “no API selection” to the confirmed selection and next gate.
- `npm run hw06:validate` passed.
- `npm run hw06:derive` completed.
- ACT-GEN-01 completed for FR-04 with 47 AI-generated candidates.
- The AI Audit operating model was corrected: `out/ai-audit-report.md` is authoritative, rows are artifact-level, and report updates are explicitly human-triggered.
- Obsolete interaction-level logging files, registry, script, and derived ledger were removed.
- Each candidate retains concise artifact-level generation context and tool information; no interaction IDs remain.
- ACT-REV-01 completed for all 47 FR-04 AI-generated candidates; verdicts and corrections are stored in `work/registry/human-reviews.json`.
- Human review result: 21 VALID, 16 INCOMPLETE corrected, 10 INVALID rejected, 37 usable AI-origin cases.
- The original 47 AI artifacts in `work/registry/test-cases.json` remain unchanged and preserved for the later AI Audit Report.
- `npm run hw06:validate` passed with 0 errors and 0 warnings after generation.
- `HANDOFF.md` was updated as the single continuation entry point.

## 13. Next action

The next substantive action is `ACT-EXT-01`: Human Extension for FR-04.

The AI Audit Report itself is not complete. It must be written or updated only after an explicit human request such as “Ghi AI Audit Report”, using one row per reviewed AI-generated artifact and the five official template fields.

The next session should:

1. read `./HANDOFF.md`;
2. read `work/selection/HW06-A-FR04-PUT-USERS-ME-verified-spec.md`;
3. inspect the ACT-EXT-01 standard;
4. add at least five student-authored FR-04 cases that AI missed;
5. record why AI missed each case in `work/registry/test-cases.json`.

Do not start `ACT-PM-01`, Postman execution, bug confirmation, GitHub Issues, or CI/CD before Human Extension is complete.

Human review summary:

```text
AI originally generated: 47
VALID as-is: 21
INCOMPLETE corrected: 16
INVALID/rejected: 10
Reviewed usable AI-origin suite: 37
```

The AI Audit Report has NOT been written or updated. It requires explicit human instruction:
`Ghi AI Audit Report`.

Recommended generation order, not a new selection decision:

```text
FR-04 PUT /api/users/me
→ FR-15 POST /api/products
→ FR-08 POST /api/checkout
```

This order minimizes early state friction; checkout should be handled after the simpler profile and product setup patterns are established.

## 14. Important unresolved blockers

- Group-level API duplication among classmates has not been externally checked; no group allocation data was available in the repository.
- CI workflow and real execution evidence are intentionally not created yet.
